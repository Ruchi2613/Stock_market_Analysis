# Database SQLite:
The stock data fetched from finance sources (Yahoo Finance) and stored in the SQLite database to reduce the need for repeated API calls, improving performance and efficiency. The application stores historical stock data locally in SQLite to display previous stock information without fetching it every time.

**Data Preprocessing:** The stk_data module functions (like get_data_by_date, RSI_calc, etc.) process data and store intermediate results in the local database.
